## Abstract

We introduce `sencha`, a novel computational method for translating RNA-seq reads to putative protein sequence.
As the direct assignment of protein-coding sequence skips both traditional alignment and gene orthology assignment it can a) be applied to transcriptomes from organisms with no or poorly annotated genomes, and b) identify putative functions of protein sequences contributing to shared cell types.
Thus, we can identify orthologous cell types while discovering *de novo* orthologous genes across species.
For widespread accessibility and usage, we implemented `sencha` into two distinct Nextflow pipelines following software best practices such as testing and continuous integration: (1) `nf-core/kmermaid` to compare translated transcriptomes across divergent species, and (2) `czbiohub/nf-predictorthologs` to infer functions of translated sequences.
Using these pipelines, we were able to align transcriptomes and discover *de novo* homologous genes across species from a variety of divergence times: bulk RNA-seq transcriptomes across Amniotes (divergence ~312 millions of years ago), mouse single-cell RNA-seq with *Botryllus schlosseri* bulk RNA-seq, an early chordate (divergence ~684 millions of years ago), and Bilateria developmental atlases (divergence ~824 millions of years ago).
By enabling analyses across divergent species' transcriptomes in an orthology-, genome- and gene annotation-agnostic manner, `sencha` illustrates the potential of non-model organisms in building the cell type evolutionary tree of life.
